# Positioning-System-Project-With-GPS-WiFi-INS-Fusion
In this project, five different sensors i.e. Accelerometer, Gyro meter, Magnetometer, GPS sensor, and WiFi sensor were used to apply sensor fusion. In particular, the sequential fusion method was studied and experimented with to find the positioning. To reduce the fluctuations and noise of INS sensors, averaging as preprocessing technique was implemented. To synchronize the sampling frequencies of different INS, a feature in the software application was added which allows users to adjust the sampling frequency of different sensors based on the application. The proposed algorithm estimates the distance using the Accelerometer and GPS sensor in short time intervals depending on the user-defined threshold. At the same time, the measurements from the magnetometer and gyro meter were fused to calculate the angular movements.
